# Example DNS configurations
{:#example-dns-configurations-for-reference}

The following screen captures show some common DNS configurations. Things to remember:

 * The `@` symbol is shorthand for the domain itself.
 * The `A`record points from a hostname (such as `domain.com` or `sub.domain.com`) to an IP address (for example, `123.123.231.1`).
 * The `CNAME` record points from a hostname (such as `domain.com` or `sub.domain.com`) to another hostname.
